# Julian's code of conduct tl;dr:

Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue, contact me. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.

Based on previous excellent work by others, this is a living code of conduct. This code of conduct applies to all of my spaces, including any sites, blogs, forums, or messaging or social media presence that I maintain, e.g. Discord, Slack, Twitter, etc.

This is an intentionally positive space that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent creators (and independence) and the diversity of people, cultures, and opinions that they bring here.

This is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, medical conditions, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), physical appearance, politics, ideology (real world or tech), or software preferences.

I value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

## Respectful behavior includes:

- Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
- If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming.
- I prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. 
- I reserve the right not to act on complaints regarding: 
    - ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’; 
    - Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.” 
    - Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
    - Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Resolve Peacefully
I believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others wish to help keep the this space respectful and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior and feel in any way unable to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to my attention. I want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just icky in any way. I will listen and work to resolve the matter.

## Apologize for Mistakes
Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, and avoiding repeating them in the future.

## Consequences
If I determine that someone is behaving disrespectfully, I may take any action I deem appropriate.

I will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for this space. I can't foresee every situation however, and thus if in my judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, I will do so.

## Resolving an Issue
If you believe you’re experiencing practices in this space that do not meet the policies below, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact me or designated code of conduct responders.

If you believe you’re experiencing practices in any of my spaces that don’t meet the policies above, please feel free to contact any ally you may know. Anyone in the community should feel empowered to resolve issues and uphold our high standards.

However if you feel the issue requires escalation, please contact me at julian.johannesen@gmail.com.
