# Cross Origin Resource Sharing

## What is the same-origin policy?
Short version: The same-origin-policy prevents bad guys from hacking your browser and doing all sorts of horrible things like stealing your credit card information. 

ensures that only resources from the "origin"  serving the document you are currently looking at are allowed to run in your browser. It prevents resources from other servers

## Why do we need it?
Because, without the same-origin policy, the page you are currently looking at in your browser could be used to run malicious code, and that code could, for example, access and interact with other open tabs in your browser, including your email services, banking services, etc.
